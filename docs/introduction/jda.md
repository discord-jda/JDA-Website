# JDA (Java Discord API)
JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST API and its Websocket-Events for Java.

If you have any suggestions/questions/feedback for this wiki, please visit the #wiki-dev channel in the [JDA Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0hMr4ce0tIk3pSjp)

!!! example "Examples"
    ```java
    public class ReadyListener implements EventListener
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
                throws InterruptedException
        {
            // Note: It is important to register your ReadyListener before building
            JDA jda = JDABuilder.createDefault("token")
                .addEventListeners(new ReadyListener())
                .build();

            // optionally block until JDA is ready
            jda.awaitReady();
        }

        @Override
        public void onEvent(GenericEvent event)
        {
            if (event instanceof ReadyEvent)
                System.out.println("API is ready!");
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    public class MessageListener extends ListenerAdapter
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            JDA jda = JDABuilder.createDefault("token")
                    .enableIntents(GatewayIntent.MESSAGE_CONTENT) // enables explicit access to message.getContentDisplay()
                    .build();
            //You can also add event listeners to the already built JDA instance
            // Note that some events may not be received if the listener is added after calling build()
            // This includes events such as the ReadyEvent
            jda.addEventListener(new MessageListener());
        }

        @Override
        public void onMessageReceived(MessageReceivedEvent event)
        {
            if (event.isFromType(ChannelType.PRIVATE))
            {
                System.out.printf("[PM] %s: %s\n", event.getAuthor().getName(),
                                        event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.printf("[%s][%s] %s: %s\n", event.getGuild().getName(),
                            event.getTextChannel().getName(), event.getMember().getEffectiveName(),
                            event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **More Examples**:
    We provide a small set of Examples in the [Example Directory](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/tree/master/src/examples/java).

## Download
You can get the latest released builds here:
[Promoted Downloads](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/releases)

If you want the most up-to-date builds, you can get them here: [Latest Build Downloads](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/releases/latest)

## Docs
Javadocs are available in both jar format and web format.<br>
The jar format is available on the [Promoted Downloads](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/releases) page or on any of the
build pages of the [legacy v4 Downloads](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/) or [v5 Downloads](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/releases/latest).<br>
<br>
The web format allows for viewing of the [Latest Docs](https://docs.jda.wiki/) or [legacy Docs](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/javadoc/) 
and also viewing of each individual build's javadoc. To view the javadoc for a specific build, you will need to go to [the GitHub release](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA/releases) for your version and download the javadoc jar for the specific build.<br>
Once you have the jar extract the files with the zip tool of your preference (winrar or 7zip, etc.) and open the `index.html` file with your internet browser.

## Getting Help
If you need help, or just want to talk with the JDA or other Devs, you can join the [Official JDA Discord Guild](https://discord.gg/0hMr4ce0tIl3SLv5).

Alternatively you can also join the [Unofficial Discord API Guild](https://discord.gg/discord-api).
Once you joined, you can find JDA-specific help in the `#java_jda` channel.
The JDA specific server will often have faster responses than the `#java_jda` channel in the Discord API server.

For guides and setup help you can also take a look at this wiki.
<br>Especially interesting are the [Getting Started](../using-jda/getting-started.md) Pages.

## Contributing to JDA
If you want to contribute to JDA, make sure to base your branch off of our **master** branch (or a feature-branch)
and create your PR into that **same** branch. **We will be rejecting any PRs between branches or into release branches!**

It is also highly recommended to get in touch with the Devs before opening Pull Requests (either through an issue or the Discord servers mentioned above).<br>
It is very possible that your change might already be in development or you missed something.

More information can be found at the wiki page [Contributing](../contributing/contributing.md)

## Dependencies
This project requires **Java 8**.<br>
