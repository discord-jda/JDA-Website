=== "Gradle Setup"

    1. If you have *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers* installed, skip to **2.**, otherwise you need to install the *Buildship Gradle Integration plugin* first:
        1. Open up Eclipse and go to the Marketplace (located under the *Help* tab)
        1. Search for *"Gradle"* and install ***Buildship Gradle Integration*** ([Plugin-Page](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration))
        1. After the plugin is installed, relaunch Eclipse

    1. Right click within *Package/Project Explorer* and select **New > Other...**

        ![New Gradle Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/01-newProject.png)

    1. In the *Gradle* folder, select **Gradle Project**

        ![Gradle Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/02-gradleProject.png)

    1. Type a name for your Project and click on *Finish*. Your setup should look like this at this point:

        ![Folder Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/03-projectOverview.png)

    1. Delete the classes within `src/main/java` and `src/test/java`

        ![Files To Delete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/04-deleteFiles.png)

    1. Open up and edit the file `build.gradle`

        ![Build_Gradle Location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/05-gradleBuildFile.png)

    1. Replace its content with the following code:

        ```groovy
        plugins {
            id("java")
            id("application")
            id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "6.0.0"
        }

        mainClassName = "com.example.jda.Bot"

        version '1.0'

        sourceCompatibility = 1.8

        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
        }

        dependencies {
            implementation("net.dv8tion:JDA:#.#.#_###")
        }

        compileJava.options.encoding = "UTF-8"
        ```

    1. Adjust the version of JDA you want to use (see dependencies-section of file) and fill in your Main-Class as soon as you have one (the one containing your `public static void main(String[] args)` method)
    1. Save the file and do the following: *Right click your project > Gradle > Refresh All*

        ![Refresh Gradle Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/06-gradleRefresh.png)

    1. Once all the dependencies have been downloaded, create your desired packages/classes in `src/main/java` and start coding!
    1. To build your project you can run `gradlew shadowJar` in a terminal of your project root, and it will produce a jar filled with your compiled code and JDA included in a single jar file! The jar can be found in `build/libs`
    1. [Setup Logback](./logging.md)
    1. Continue with [Getting Started](../using-jda/getting-started.md)


=== "Maven Setup"

    Prerequisites: Maven-Plugin and local Maven installation

    1. Create a new Maven project. (File -> New -> Other -> Maven -> Maven Project)

        ![New Maven Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/10-newProject.png)

    1. Check the `Create a simple project` box on the next page as we don't need to worry about archetypes.

        ![Check Simple Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/11-checkSimpleProject.png)

    1. Add a groupId, artifactId and a name. Make sure you try to follow the [naming conventions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html) while you are at this step. The result could look like the image below.

        ![Project Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/12-mvnValues.png)

    1. Now let's start configuring it, first off, open up your pom.xml and add the following lines right after `</description>`
    ```xml
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
    </properties>
    ```
    - This will make your project support UTF-8 characters (So you can have it on Japanese servers for example) and also force Java 8, which is needed.

    1. Now, add the dependency, make sure you change `X.Y.Z-beta.W` to the latest version number (You can find it in the releases: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases)
        ```xml
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
            <groupId>net.dv8tion</groupId>
            <artifactId>JDA</artifactId>
            <version>X.Y.Z-beta.W</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        ```

    1. Now you need to set up the (build) maven-shade and maven-compile plugins, add the following lines right after `</dependencies>`
        
        !!! note
            The following changes will force the compiler to use Java 8 (JDA needs it), so make sure you have it installed.

        ```xml
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.8.1</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <source>1.8</source>
                        <target>1.8</target>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
                <plugin>
                    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.2.4</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <transformers>
                            <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
                                <mainClass>YourMainClass</mainClass> <!-- (1) -->
                            </transformer>
                        </transformers>
                        <createDependencyReducedPom>false</createDependencyReducedPom>
                    </configuration>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <phase>package</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>shade</goal>
                            </goals>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
        ```

        1. You have to replace this with a path to your main class like `me.myname.mybotproject.Main`

    1. After that, the project must be updated to download the dependencies. *Right click > Maven > Update Project*

        ![Maven Update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/assets/assets/wiki/setup/eclipse/13-mvnUpdate.png)  

    1. You are done! Now you can head to the [Javadocs](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/javadoc/) or see examples at the [Examples](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/tree/master/src/examples/java) page.
    1. [Setup Logback](./logging.md)
